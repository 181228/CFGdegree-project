**Project Concept:** ReadSwap is a platform that aims to address the challenge of unused and idle books by facilitating book exchange, sale, or gifting among book enthusiasts. It encourages sustainable reading practices and minimizes book waste by allowing users to unlock the full potential of their book collections.

**Who will this help:** ReadSwap will benefit individuals who still value the tactile experience of reading paper books and wish to share, exchange, sell, or gift their books with others. It also caters to book enthusiasts in search of rare and out-of-print books, fostering a vibrant community of like-minded readers.

**The tools to be used:** The ReadSwap platform can be developed using various web development tools and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a back-end programming language like Node.js or Python. Additionally, a database system like MySQL may be employed to manage book listings and user information. User authentication and security features should also be implemented to ensure a safe and seamless experience for all users.

**Design Justification**
Our aim was to ensure that users could navigate from page to page effortlessly, and that the arrangement of elements would not impede the overall readability of the page. We applied fundamental principles of digital graphics when selecting media:

- Keeping things simple ('Less is more')
- Using a cohesive color palette and design elements
- Maintaining control over typography
- Considering visual hierarchy
- Incorporating white space and spacing
- Taking psychology of color into account

The color palette we have chosen is warm and neutral, consisting of earthy tones, predominantly bronzes, oranges, and greens. We aimed to select colors that evoke the feeling of old book covers. The chosen colors are bright and subdued, providing the site with a soft appearance that, hopefully, will allow users to browse comfortably without overwhelming their eyes with excessive contrast. We approached the site as a canvas for the booksâ€”the most essential elements of the site, without which it could not exist.

The only contrasting elements we used were variations in the background, navigation bar, and buttons. This contrast makes it easier for users to navigate the site and understand the nature of the displayed content.
