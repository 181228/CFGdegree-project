**Project Concept:** ReadSwap is a platform that aims to address the challenge of unused and idle books by facilitating book exchange, sale, or gifting among book enthusiasts. It encourages sustainable reading practices and minimizes book waste by allowing users to unlock the full potential of their book collections.

**Who will this help:** ReadSwap will benefit individuals who still value the tactile experience of reading paper books and wish to share, exchange, sell, or gift their books with others. It also caters to book enthusiasts in search of rare and out-of-print books, fostering a vibrant community of like-minded readers.

**The tools to be used:** The ReadSwap platform can be developed using various web development tools and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a back-end programming language like Node.js or Python. Additionally, a database system like MySQL may be employed to manage book listings and user information. User authentication and security features should also be implemented to ensure a safe and seamless experience for all users.

**The tasks division:** 
**Time Frame: 27 days**

**Main features:**

- Book Sale: ReadSwap allows users to sell their books to interested buyers, creating a marketplace for second-hand books.

- Rare Book Search: The platform offers a search feature to help users find rare and out-of-print books that may not be easily available elsewhere.

**Design Justification:**
Our aim is to ensure that users can navigate from page to page effortlessly, and that the arrangement of elements does not impede the overall readability of the page. We are applying fundamental principles of digital graphics when selecting media:

- Keeping things simple ('Less is more')
- Using a cohesive color palette and design elements
- Maintaining control over typography
- Considering visual hierarchy
- Incorporating white space and spacing
- Taking psychology of color into account

The color palette we have chosen is warm and neutral, consisting of earthy tones, predominantly bronzes and greens. Our goal is to select colors that evoke the feeling of old book covers. The chosen colors are bright and subdued, providing the site with a soft appearance that, hopefully, allows users to browse comfortably without overwhelming their eyes with excessive contrast. We are approaching the site as a canvas for the booksâ€”the most essential elements of the site, without which it could not exist.

The only contrasting elements we are using are variations in the background, navigation bar, and buttons. We believe this contrast makes it easier for users to navigate the site and understand the nature of the displayed content.

When it comes to typography, for similar clarity and cohesiveness reasons as with the color palette, we would like to keep the number of fonts used to a minimum (considering two as plenty, and one as sufficient). We will utilize simple, standard fonts such as Google Web Fonts or Typekit to ensure the website displays correctly regardless of circumstances and does not distract the user from reading the content. Therefore, the chosen font should have easily distinguishable letters and be suitable for various sizes. Currently, we are considering Roboto, DejaVu Sans, Consolas, or Montserrat.

Our website wireframes can be found below. We've organized them with a first-time user in mind, ensuring a smooth flow as follows:

  -> Landing Page               | Ann opens the page using the URL <br /> 
  -> Registration/Login Page    | She decides to create an account <br /> 
  -> User Profile               | Ann checks how her profile appears to the public audience <br /> 
  -> User Profile Settings      | She decides to update some information about herself <br /> 
  -> Book Upload                | With a book to swap, Ann visits the Book Upload page and fills in the book data <br /> 
  -> Books Listing              | She explores books listed by others, looking for ones she's interested in buying/swapping <br /> 
  -> Book Details               | Ann finds 2 books intriguing but is unsure which to choose; she adds both to the Cart <br /> 
  -> Book Cart                  | Ann reviews the Cart, makes a final book selection, clicks to mark it, and proceeds to check shipping options <br /> 
  -> Shipping                   | She fills in her address, webiste calculates shipping cost, and Ann proceeds to the Payment Gateway <br /> 
  -> Payment Gateway            | She enters her payment details and receives payment confirmation <br /> 
  -> Rare Book Search           | A particular book crosses Ann's mind; she has been searching for it tirelessly. She decides to inquire about it on the Rare Book Search forum, in case someone is willing to give it away, swap, or sell. <br />
