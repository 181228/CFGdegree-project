  # ReadSwap-App

To preview and run the project on your device:

  1. Download the project folder `readswap-app`
  2. Open the `readswap-app` directory in VSCode
  3. In the terminal, navigate to the root of the project (where the `package.json` file is located) and run `npm install`.
  4. Navigate to the `server` folder directory within the project, and run `node server.js` in a new terminal window.
  4. Open a second terminal (without closing the first one) and run `npm start` to view the project in your web browser.

  5. **Important:** Once you're done, press `Ctrl+C` in both terminal windows to stop the local servers.
  6. Before sending updates to GitHub, please delete the `node_modules` folder to keep the repository clean.
